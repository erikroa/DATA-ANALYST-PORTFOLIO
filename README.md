My name is Erik. I'm a Revenue Operations and Customer Analytics professional with 8+ years in B2B SaaS, now focused on turning operational data into actionable business insights.
I combine deep domain expertise in subscription revenue, customer lifecycle, and deal desk analytics with hands-on technical skills in SQL, Python, BigQuery, and Looker Studio. My approach starts with the business question, then I build the analysis, automation, or dashboard to answer it.

This portfolio showcases end-to-end analytics projects: from data extraction and cleaning through SQL analysis to interactive dashboards. Each project tackles a real business problem - support bottleneck identification, payment operations optimization, and SaaS revenue analysis, demonstrating both technical execution and the ability to communicate findings that drive decisions.
