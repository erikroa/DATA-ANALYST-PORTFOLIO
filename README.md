My name is Erik. I am a Revenue Expert and Data Analyst with hands-on experience using a range of data tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data, supporting decision-making and driving meaningful change. I work confidently with SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python, and have a strong grasp of core analytics practices such as data preparation, data wrangling, statistical analysis, chart design, dashboard development, process documentation, and data storytelling.

This portfolio highlights data projects that reflect both my technical skill set and analytical thinking. It includes documents, workbooks, presentation decks, and dashboards built with SQL, Tableau, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, and PowerPoint. Together, these projects demonstrate my ability to structure, analyze, and communicate data clearly, enabling stakeholders to understand insights and make informed decisions quickly.
